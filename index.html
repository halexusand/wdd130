                <p>Hello! My name is Hayli Sanders and I am from Spokane Washington. I love the summer months around Spokane because of all the nature activities there are near the city. There are 76 lakes in the Spokane area! I currently live in Rexburg Idaho while I attend college at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I also have a huge passion for learning languages. I have learned intermediate amounts of both Spanish and Russian. This love of language is what initially inspired me to learn how to code. Just as I believe in the value of spoken-language communication, I also value the free flow of information and communication that the internet provides us. I am so excited to share my continued improvement as my programming skills progress in the future!</p>
