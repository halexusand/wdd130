            <h2>Testimonial</h2>
            <p>Jared Zimmerman - "Sending my son on Water Wonderland's Level 1 kids rafting adventure helped my son gain maturity and confidence in ways that I am so thankful for. We are an active family and wanted to instill a sense of love and respect for nature within my son Ian. I could not have asked for a better program to nurture that within him. All instructors were knowledgeable and fun. My son had a blast and I felt peace as a parent the whole time knowing that he was safe! </p>
