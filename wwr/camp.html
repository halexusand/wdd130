        <h1>Teenager Rafting Overnight Camp!</h1>
        <p>This is a great experience for your older kids aged 14-17! For two weeks they will go on a rafting expedition along the Colorado river. No experience is required. They will start out the first 2 days learning water safety on calm level 1 waters with our kids day camp program. After initial safety training is provided they will raft along the river to their camp location each night. We will provide three meals a day for the kids but, its not a bad idea for them to bring their own snacks! We have many returning teens who have made lasting friendships and love the camp. The total program fee is $750. Сontact us to apply!</p>
